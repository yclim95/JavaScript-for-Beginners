#Lab Exercise 8

1. Create a new HTML document with the basic document structure. In the body, insert a set of script tags with the appropriate attributes so that you may insert Javascript into the document.

2. Declare a variable called `“poem”` in the Javascript.

3. Using concatenation, add the following text to `“poem”`. Use `<br/>` tags at the end of each line to create line breaks.

```
With Rue My Heat Is Laden
For Golden Friends I had
For Many a Rose-Lipped Maiden
And Many a Light-Foot Lad

By Brooks To Broad For Leaping
The Light-Foot Boys are Laid
The Rose-Lipped Girls are Sleeping
In Fields Where Roses Fade
``` 

4. Create a loop to iterate through the string one letter at a time. Create a new string **variable** and within the loop access each character in the `poem` – from the first character to the final character.

5. While in the loop, if the character is a vowel, `replace` it with an “X” and add that character to the new string. If the letter is a consonant, simply add it to the new string.

6. Output the poem with the changes made by the loop. It should output like this:

```
WXth RXX My HXXt Xs LXdXn
FXr GXldXn FrXXnds X hXd
FXr MXny X RXsX-LXppXd MXXdXn
Xnd MXny X LXght-FXXt LXd

By BrXXks TX BrXXd FXr LXXpXng
ThX LXght-FXXt BXys XrX LXXd
ThX RXsX-LXppXd GXrls XrX SlXXpXng
Xn FXXlds WhXrX RXsXs FXdX
``` 

7. Create a new **variable** and assign it the value: “tennis,ice,hockey,baseball,basketball,football,soccer,bowling”

8. Using the correct string method, **convert the string into an array** with each sport occupying an array index.

9. `Sort` the array alphabetically and output the array by looping through it.
