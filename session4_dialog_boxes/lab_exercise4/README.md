#Lab Exercise 4

1. Create an HTML document with the basic document structures as demonstrated in the Chapter 1 lecture. In the document body add script tags with the appropriate attributes to add Javascript code.

2. Using the correct dialog box code, create a box that contains the text “What is your dog’s age in human years?” The user should be able to type their response directly into the dialog box.

3. Store the user’s response in a variable called `dogAgeInHumanYears`.

4. Multiply the `dogAgeInHumanYears` value by 7 and store in a variable called `doAgeInDogYears`.

5. Use an `alert()` box to output the result with the text: “Your dog is X years old in dog years.

6. After the user acknowledges the alert() box, another dialog should appear and ask the user, “Shall I exit the program?” This dialog should display two buttons, allowing the user to “Confirm” or “Cancel”.

7. If the user selects “Confirm,” then the text: “Exiting Dog Years Calculator” should appear. If the user selects “Cancel,” then the text: “Cancelling Exit” should appear.
