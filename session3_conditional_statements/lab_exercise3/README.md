#Lab Exercise 3

1. Create an HTML document with the basic document structure as demonstrated in the Chapter 1 lecture. In the document body add script tags with the appropriate attributes to add Javascript code.

2. Declare a variable called `age` and assign it the value `35`. Using the chart below code correct **if...else...if** statements to produce the correct output according to the value in age.



| Age Range  | Output                         | 
| -----------|:------------------------------:| 
| Under 18   |"You’re just a pup!"|
| 18-29      |"Welcome to young adulthood... Have fund now (while you can!)"|
| 30-39      |"It’s time to get serious about career and family"|
| 40-49      |"Time to start thinking abut retirement. Make sure you’re saving."|
| 50-59      |"Enjoy your life now! You’ve dont well."|
| 60 or Over |"60 is the new 40. Do something exciting!"|

3. Test your code. Try changing the value in age and make sure it still works correctly.

4. Declare and initialize a variable called `discountCode` and assign it the value `C`. Declare another variable called `discountRate`. Use a **switch/case/break** structure to determine the value of `discountRate` based on the `discountCode`. If the discount code is A the discount rate is .0325. If the discount code is B the discount rate is .05. If the discount code is C the discount rate is .075. If the discount rate is D the discount rate is .10.

5. Before the switch declare a variable called `amountOfSale` and set its initial value to `27.95`. Using the correct math operators and document.write output the amountOfSale after the discount code is applied. Remember that if you use parentheses in an expression whatever is between the opening and closing parentheses will be executed first.

6. Adjust your code so it still works if the discount code were entered as a lower case letter.
