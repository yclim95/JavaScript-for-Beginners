#Lab Exercise 5

1. Create an HTML document with the basic document structure as demonstrated in the Chapter 1 lecture. In the document body add script tags with the appropriate attributes to add Javascript code.

2. Create a while loop that counts backwards from 500 to 0 by 5’s. Output the results with a break between each line.

3. Create a second loop that is a do...while loop. Design the loop so that the initial condition is false. Observe that the loop will still iterate one time even though the continuation condition is initially false.

4. Create a for loop that outputs the words “I can count... Wow!” 10 times. Each time the content is output it should be preceded by the number of the iteration. The first iteration should output “1. I can count...Wow!”, the second “2. I can count...Wow!” and so on.

5. In a new HTML document, create a program that prompts the user for an interest rate (entered as a decimal such as .05 for 5%), an amount of money
invested and a term (in months). Using these values create a table in the document window that displays how much money the user has earned
each month in interest and what their new total is. See the browser output on the next page for an approximation of how the result should look.

```
The interest accrued each month: totalMoney * interestRate
```

```
The total each month: totalMoney + (interestRate * totalMoney)
```
