#Lab Exercise 2

1. Create an HTML document with the basic document structure as demonstrated in the Chapter 1 lecture. In the document body add script tags with the appropriate attributes to add Javascript code.

2. Declare (but do not yet initialize) the following variables*(Your first name, last name, age, city, favouriteFood.)*

3. Initialize the variables with information about you. *(Your first name, last name, age, city, favouriteFood.)*

4. Create a variable called operand1 and use **combined initialization** and assignment to assign it an initial value of 1555.

5. Create a variable called operand2 and used **combined initialization** and assignment to assign it an initial value of 96.255.

6. Demonstrate your knowledge of the mathematical operators with operand1 and operand2 by adding, dividing, multiply, dividing the two values. Format your output as follows:

`1555 + 96.255 = 1651.255`

The line of code that would produce this output is:


```javascript
document.write(operand1 + “ + “ + operand2 + “ = “ + (operand1+operand2));
```

7. Demonstrate your knowledge of the **increment** and **decrementing** operators by incrementing operand1 and decrementing operand2. Display the results after using the increment and decrement operators.
