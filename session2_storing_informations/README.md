#Session2 Storing Information

## Variable 
In the previous lesson, we learned how to output to the browser and it seems alright to leave it like this. But, what will happen if we want to store the output for future purpose. 

Here comes the need of **variable**.

### 1. Variable Declaration 

```javascript
var userName; // Variable Declaration
```

### 2. Variable Initialization  

```javascript
userName = "YC Lim"; // Variable Initialization
```

**Alternative:**

```javascript
var userName = "YC Lim";
```

### 3. Output variable

```javascript
var userName; // Variable Declaration
userName = "YC Lim"; // Variable Initialization
document.write(userName); //Output the variable
```
