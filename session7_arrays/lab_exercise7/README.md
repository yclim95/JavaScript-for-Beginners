#Lab Exercise 7

1. Create a new HTML document with the basic document structure. In the body, insert a set of script tags with the appropriate attributes so that you may insert Javascript in to the document.

2. Create an array called `placesToVisit` using any of the three methods demonstrated in lecture. Populate the array with the name of at least five places you’d like to visit.

3. Using a for loop, loop through the array outputting the name of each location using `document.write()`.

4. If necessary refer to a Javascript Array reference if necessary and use the appropriate methods to add the city “Boise” to the end of the array.

5. In the document head insert a set of script tags after the title tag. Be sure to use the appropriate attributes so that you may insert Javascript.

6. Move the loop that outputs the array in to a function called `outputArray` in the head script. Make your function take a single parameter called `theArray`. Modify the loop
so theArray is output.

7. From the script in the body, after you have added “Boise” to the array, call the `outputArray()` function passing it the `placesToVisit` array.

8. Using the appropriate Javascript method remove the first two members of the array.

9. Call the `outputArray()` function again to output the array after the changes are made.

10. Using the appropriate Javascript method, sort the array alphabetically.

11. Using the function you created output the array a final time.

12. Save and test your code in the browser. Debug as necessary to get the correct output.
